                            Chances are, this is a textbook case of crying wolf—or this person may have a very distorted sense
                            of what 'urgent' really means. Either way, he or she wants attention but doesn't really need help,
                            and you don't have time to deal with this sort of immaturity right now. Let the drama distract someone else.

                            If you aren't ready to hear other people's versions of the truth, let them know (in no uncertain terms).
                            Your ego is exceptionally sensitive lately, partially due to a power struggle that you lost.

According to Chinese astrology, the year of a person's birth is represented by one of these animals. The twelve animal signs or zodiac symbols are Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig.

<h2>
SOME TRUE FACTS ABOUT ASTROLOGY
</h2>
</div>
<div class = "paragrafi">
<p>
According to a 1999 study, the word horoscope and astrology are the two most searched topics on the Internet. Astrology is considered to be both an art and a science. Astrology is art because interpretation is needed to bring the different aspects together and formulate an idea of the individual's character traits. However, the mathematical part of astrology is also considered to be a science because it requires an understanding of astronomy and mathematics. Sixtus IV was the first Catholic pope to draw and interpret a horoscope, Leo X and Paul III always relied on astrologers for advice while Julius II has chosen his coronation date astrologically. Astrology was very important to Adolf Hitler, the dictator of Nazi Germany. It is thought that the German leader consulted astrologers throughout the Second World War.>

    <h2>Çmimet dhe garat në Galerinë e Kosovës</h2>
</div>
<div class="text_col">
    E themeluar në vitin 1979, Galeria Kombëtare e Kosovës është rritur për t'u
     bërë një nga institucionet më aktive kulturore publike të periudhës së pasluftës
      në Kosovë. Duke qenë institucioni i vetëm publik për prezantimin e arteve pamore 
      në Kosovë, ky institucion merret me promovimin e artit bashkëkohor në përgjithësi 
      (arti konceptual, performanca, instalimi, video, si dhe piktura dhe skulptura). 
      Përveç programit të tij kryesor të ekspozitave, NGK zhvillon programin e Kërkimit 
      dhe Publikimit, një program arsimor shumë i pasur që u përmirësua kohët e fundit, 
      si dhe Programi i leksioneve dhe debateve. NGK zotëron një koleksion të gjallë prej
       1000 veprash që përfshijnë krijimet e artistëve kosovarë dhe jugosllavë, si dhe
        ndërkombëtarë, në periudhën që nga vitet '60 të shekullit të kaluar e deri më tani.
         Ky institucion punon për mesazhe paqeje, tolerance dhe bashkëpunimi ndëretnik dhe 
         është përpjekur shumë për të krijuar ura bashkëpunimi midis institucioneve kulturore
          dhe artistëve brenda rajonit dhe më gjerë. Që nga lufta në Kosovë, NGK ka organizuar
           ekspozita të shumta kolektive dhe individuale, lokale dhe ndërkombëtare, dhe është
            vizituar nga qindra mijëra dashamirës të artit. Kjo ekspozitë dhe çmim u iniciua në 
            vitin 2003 nga Ministria e Kulturës e Kosovës dhe u emërua pas një prej pionierëve më
             të vlerësuar të artit bashkëkohor dhe një prej themeluesve të Fakultetit të Artit.
              Krijuar me një qëllim të qartë: për të promovuar artin pamor në Kosovë, sot 
              Muslim Mulliqi është ekspozita më domethënëse për artet pamore bashkëkohore në Kosovë. 
              Ajo gjithashtu ka fituar besueshmëri midis rajonit dhe më gjerë për shkak të punës së 
              shkëlqyeshme të kuratorëve dhe artistëve të famshëm të ftuar për të ekspozuar. Kuratorët 
              që kanë një prestigj të konsiderueshëm në botën e artit, dhe që janë në një farë mase të 
              njohur me skenën tonë lokale, janë të ftuar të krijojnë një koncept për ekspozitën dhe të
               zgjedhin pjesëmarrës vendas dhe ndërkombëtar. Një juri profesionale, 
    ndërkombëtare zgjedh gjithashtu një fitues që merr një çmim për veprën më të mirë të artit të paraqitur.
